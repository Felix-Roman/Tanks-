# Tanks-
My First Tanks Game Using Unity 3D C#

What I learned to do
-Work with the Unity Editor (Scenes, GameObjects, Components)
-Use Prefabs and instantiate objects into the scene
-Customize Inspector fields and work with Serialized Variables
-Use Transforms, parenting, pivots, and model positioning
-Understand the lifecycle of MonoBehaviours (Start, Update, etc.)

Gameplay Programming
-layer input (movement, rotation, shooting)
-AI movement & decision making
-Health, damage, explosions, respawning
-Projectile physics and collision

These are essential to any action, shooter, or RPG game.
-Use NavMesh to move around the environment
-Detect and target the player
-Use NavMeshAgent.SetDestination()
-Avoid obstacles and follow paths
-Switch between player-controlled and computer-controlled modes

This will direclty help me with
-NPCs
-Enemies
-Boss fights
-Support characters
-Pathfinding in strategy and simulation games

Navigating Mesh Systems
-How to bake NavMeshes
-How agent types work (Humanoid, Tank, custom agents)
-How movement, radius, height, and slope affect AI
-How environments influence pathfinding
-How to debug why agents don’t move or get stuck

These skills are used in
-FPS AI
-MOBAs like League of Legends
-Tactical games like XCOM
-Strategy games
-Open-world NPC behavior

I also Learned how to
-Use/Create Prefabs
-UI Creation/Management
-Start Scenes
-Transitions
-Game Managers
-Tank Managers
-Round Systems
-Spawn Systems
-Problem Solving issues varying from mesh to prefabs and etc.

Next I will use what I have learned to make another fun game and see what else I can learn on the way!
